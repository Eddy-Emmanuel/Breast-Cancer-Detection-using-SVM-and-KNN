# Breast Cancer Detection using SVM and KNN

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset used for training and evaluation is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, curated by Dr. William H. Wolberg.
